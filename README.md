# One-Button-Game-NINJAs-Journey
This is a one butten game using processing 2, with ninjas, beans and beans.

This actually is a prototype for the class of User Interface Designe in the winter semester of 2014/15 at the University of Salzburg. I am using the Processing Java core library and some other stuff we were using in a similar project.

Have Fun
